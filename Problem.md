### 🧩 Problem Statement

---

## Overview

In many households, people often struggle to decide what to cook with the ingredients they already have at home. This leads to food wastage, repetitive meals, and time spent browsing recipes that don’t match available ingredients.
For instance, imagine opening your fridge and finding half a tomato, a few eggs, and some spinach — but you’re not sure what to make out of them. You might end up ordering food instead, letting those ingredients spoil.
While recipe apps and websites exist, most require manual ingredient entry, which is tedious and inaccurate. There’s a growing need for an intelligent system that can understand what ingredients are available simply by analyzing an image and then suggest recipes instantly.

## Problem Description

Despite technological advancements in the food-tech sector, ingredient recognition and contextual recipe generation remain underexplored. Users must still type in what ingredients they have or browse through long recipe lists manually.

Key pain points include:

- 🍅 Manual entry fatigue: Users must type each ingredient they have.
- 🥦 Food waste: People often forget or fail to use perishable items in time.
- 🕒 Decision fatigue: It’s hard to decide “what to cook today” even when the fridge is full.
- 📱 Lack of personalization: Current recipe apps rarely adapt to available ingredients or dietary preferences automatically.

## Example Scenario

Let’s say a user takes a photo of their fridge.
The image shows: milk, eggs, cheese, and spinach.

A traditional recipe app would require them to manually type each ingredient and search for matching recipes.
Our AI-powered solution, however, would automatically detect those items and instantly suggest dishes like “Spinach Omelette” or “Cheesy Egg Muffins” — no manual input needed.

## Why It Matters

This problem impacts:

- Students and working individuals with limited time to plan meals.
- Families looking to reduce food waste and grocery costs.
- Health-conscious users wanting to make the most of their fresh ingredients.
- Sustainability efforts that aim to reduce household food waste.

A solution that can automatically detect ingredients and generate recipes on the spot would simplify daily cooking, reduce waste, and encourage smarter food usage.

## Problem Goal

Develop an AI-powered system that:

- Analyzes an image (e.g., fridge, pantry, or plate) to identify visible food ingredients.
- Generates personalized recipes using the detected ingredients.
- Minimizes manual input and provides users with creative, practical, and healthy meal options.

---

## Key Challenges

- Accurate ingredient detection from cluttered or low-quality images.
- Mapping detected ingredients to viable, contextually relevant recipes.
- Handling diverse cuisines and ingredient variations.
- Integrating AI models (CV + LLM) efficiently for fast real-time responses.

## Expected Impact

By bridging computer vision and generative AI, the project aims to:

- Reduce household food waste.
- Save users time in daily cooking decisions.
- Encourage creativity and sustainability in home cooking.
- Demonstrate practical use of AI in everyday life.
